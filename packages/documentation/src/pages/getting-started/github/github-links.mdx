These DevOps services are hosted on private domains but can be accessed your web browser using an SSH script with the SwitchyOmega Chrome plugin to route web requests from your browser to the SOCKS5 proxy. If you have your PIV background check approved (eQIP adjudication), you may also request access to AWS Console for "troubleshooting, log file review, and to apply changes to the running instances and services" on AWS GovCloud.

  The [Nightwatch e2e tests will run axe scans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-accessibility-best-practices.md#build-pipeline-requirements) to enforce Section 508, WCAG2 A and WCAG2 AA compliance; however, to avoid unnecessary churn, developers are expected to procatively run [local scans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/508-accessibility-best-practices.md#getting-started-with-automation) using [axe](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-web-accessibility-tes/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd) and [axe-coconut](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-coconut-web-accessibi/iobddmbdndbbbfjopjdgadphaoihpojp) Chrome extensions to identify and resolve [ruleset violations](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe) early on, during coding. (Staging Review requests will be denied if axe scan detects any issues not already disclosed/waived/mitigated in the Known Issues section of the request ticket.) For further guidance, consult the [Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/testing-by-practice-area.md), [Dev Review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/accessibility-dev-review-step-by-step.md), [Defect Severity](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/defect-severity-rubric.md), and [Post-Launch Audit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/post-launch-audit-processes.md) accessibility pages.

  https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/READMES/cms-login.md \
  Depending on the work that you do, you may need access to the Drupal CMS. To gain access to Drupal, a VA email address and access to the VA network (via CAG or a GFE) is required. Users can log on via CAG with a username and password or a PIV. If you have a VA email and VA network access, follow these instructions to create a Drupal CMS account.

- **GitHub: VA<span/>.gov | Private | DevOps | External Service Integrations** \
  https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/devops/tree/master/docs/External%20Service%20Integrations
  Pages in this area describe integrations between va.gov and external services, including services within the VA and services managed by third parties. These pages are intended for VSP on-call support but are somewhat useful as general summaries for back-end developers and systems integrators as well. Each page contains a general description of a service, how it integrates with va.gov, environment specific details (such as endpoints), required configuration, and--for incident management purposes--troubleshooting steps, escalation procedures, and contact information. The information in these pages are considered system security sensitive, so you'll need access to the VA's private DevOps GitHub repository in order to see them.
