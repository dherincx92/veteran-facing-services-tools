## What We Do

We are actively working on https://va.gov, the user-centered, public-facing website where veterans and their caregivers can find, apply for, track, and manage their benefits in one place.

- DEPO: The VA Digital Experience Product Office. VSP and VSA fall under DEPO.
- VSA: [Veteran-facing Services Applications (VSA)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa#veteran-facing-services-applications-vsa); our team (applications).
- VSP: [Veteran-facing Services Platform](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/README.md#veteran-facing-services-platform-vsp); the platform team, which includes framework and DevOps.
- VFS: Veteran Facing Services (consumers of VSP, including VSA).
